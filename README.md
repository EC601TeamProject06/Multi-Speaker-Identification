# Multi-Speaker-Identification

* Introduction

  Speaker recognition is defined as identifying a person based on his/her voice characteristics. This is useful in applications for authentication to identify authorized users, for example, enable access control using voice of an individual. Most of times there are scenarios where multiple speakers speak simultaneously, single speaker identification systems fail to handle such audio signals. Therefore, it is significant to make the speaker recognition systems to handle multi-speaker audoi files and classify them.
